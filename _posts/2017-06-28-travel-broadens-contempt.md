title: Travel broadens contempt
tags: [society]
excerpt: Traveling; exotic cocktails, idyllic weather, the abdication of all responsibility and time constraints for the space of a few days or weeks, which conveniently also makes one a better person. Never was anything so rewarding yet pleasurable.

Their sails raised high so as to balloon by any wind of bullshit that comes by, hubristic backpackers will claim that "travel broadens the mind." But does it truly increases the range of one's knowledge or does one feels obliged to make such a high claim in order to avoid the Christian guilt that would otherwise result from indulging oneself?

It seems rather convenient that such a pleasurable and relaxing pursuit, sipping exotic cocktails while lying horizontally on a chaise longue in idyllic weather, would let one open its mind to great ideas and better understand customs dramatically different than one's own. Tiger beer, however cold, is rarely the source of such epiphanies, and we better promote genuine life enriching experiences.

I take issue with the oversimplified premise that closed-mindedness arises from---one not being aware of diverging perspectives. If that were true, than perhaps a trifling trip abroad would remedy to racism, bigotry, and prejudice but it clearly does not stand to reason as those we perceive as closed-minded are generally well aware of the ideas they repudiate.

  Though most like to claim being open to new ideas, no one actually wants to risk the catastrophic implosion of one's bubble of assumptions and opinions, the very foundation of one's identity, by allowing in a few conflicting thoughts. It is greatly diminishing the accomplishment and hardship that come with changing its stance on issues that forge one's personality and character to contemptuously suggest that merely coming into contact with fellow human beings of different beliefs over a beer opens the mind. Honest admission that one's convictions are fallacious is a life-altering act that requires courage, solicitude and cerebration which those who make such a high claim do not seem to dispose.

If traveling certainly does not make one unprejudiced, living abroad, at the very least forces one to face opposing points of view. Punters skim through a culture while expatriates are compelled to work, dine and sleep with different ideas. Interactions the tourist does not even contemplate. One will also have many of its notions challenged, one will engage in heated discussions where one will have to defend its point of view while besieged by rival and cohesive arguments; one will ultimately win some arguments and concede others. This is a true test one's belief and identity that is guaranteed to make one a better and more knowledgeable person.

I also cannot help but point out the numerous other ways that are at our disposal to improve our knowledge of society and others. You will learn much more about Russia and its history by reading Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov than by visiting Moscow. You will grasp a lot more about the United States by reading Thomas Paine's Rights of Man than by going to New York for a few days.

If traveling truly broadened the mind and---that this was the aim of the trip---punters would go to places where opinions diverge a great deal rather than Paris, lenient Buddhist places or beach laden islands.
