The mere possibility of having another Clintonian term strikes me as frightening given the rule of William Jefferson Clinton over the nineties comprised of a miasma of filthy political initiatives, numerous rape accusations, questionable donations and other malignant exertions of authority in which the then-first lady was regrettably complicit. Nothing Jeffersonian but a slice of the name; he shall thus be referred to as "Bill" so as to amputate his name like he severed Al-Shifa from Somalia.

The Clintonian affliction is upon us once more, and though it is to be inflicted through the same political scheme it is now to come from his female complement. Triangulation is the brilliant but dishonest political strategy coined by Bill's then-chief political advisor Dick Morris to get him reelected in 1996 and that which is unfortunately very likely to get his conspiring wife in office this time about.

Hillary's health care plan, the brilliance of which was it's very failure, is the embodiment of triangulation and all that is morally wrong with it. In 1993 Bill set a task force headed by his wife to devise the plan; coverage would be financed by payroll taxes and delivered through regulated competition amongst *large* for-profit health maintenance organisations. The plan brought the worst of two worlds together, central planning and crony capitalism, there's nothing quite like guaranteed revenue and monopoly to either faction and as such was, contrary to popular belief, supported--through large donations---by the pharmaceutical industry, doctors, insurances, etc.

The backlash from the smaller players who were to be priced out of the market by the plan was expected by the administration, it formed an essential part of the scheme: the third vertex of the triangle. Some healthcare providers mustered just about enough for a collective telly ad campaign denouncing Hillarycare,  providing the indispensable scapegoat when the plan later fell under scrutiny and subsequently lost support. The aforementioned minute and mediocre opposing force that had dared to voice its discontent was framed as emissary of the whole industry onto which all blame could be piled.

It should have ended then. It didn't.

The triangulated pyramidion position allows one to shift focus towards the other end of the political spectrum (when losing support from one faction, please the other), and instead pass a bill far more harsh than any republican could ever hope for at the time. Bill and Hill' did not just "get away with it," they managed to appear in the guise of victims fallen to an unscrupulous pressure group in a just fight for an honorable cause, having at the same time reaped donations from the very lobby they portrayed as evil and robbed the republicans of a political victory. The genius of the manoeuvre is that it insulates the triangulator from any wrongdoing.

Democrats only owned 43 percent of Congress at the time, the bill had no chance to pass, and that they very well realised. This was also evident to Dick Morris who knew that the President had recently been elected "against all odds" thanks to his strategy and that Bill's meagre reputation would dwindle from his inaugural address onwards. If the plan could not be approved then, it would never be.

Much of that if not all, is still very much present in Hillary's Presidential candidacy. Like Bill in 1996, she combed through the Republican program to steal its supportable ends and its donors along with it (she might as well take money from lobbies, those who hate Wall Street will vote Sanders anyhow). While simultaneously distancing herself from her rival Bernie Sanders, yet suggesting at every opportunity that she "is not that different from senator Sanders," and when her policies differ from that of Bernie she reminds us that she loyally served under the Obama administration (to give the impression that she nonetheless holds the Democrat's core values), eventually positioning herself in the convenient "middle." Her strategy is nefarious and void of any value or principle.

Every political issue is in fact assessed in opinion polls, she knows which view is prevalent among the public---at the time---and takes the corresponding stance. However, with time, opinions change and so must her message, hence being known for "changing position."

In the late nineties/early noughties marriage equality was scarcely supported, thus, to ride the wave of public opinion, it "made sense" for Bill to sign The Defense of Marriage Act and for Hillary to state:

> Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman.
> -- <cite>Hillary Clinton, January 2000</cite>

She eventually recapitulated this drivel in the senate four years later. But It did not refrain her from dramatically changing her position on the issue, and in the most feeble manner to meet in many day's march at that, with a slender rainbow-colored logo and a trivial tweet posted on April 28, 2015, the day the Supreme Court was to hear arguments about same-sex marriage.

> Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait.
> --<cite>Hillary Clinton, April 2015</cite>

I would have thought that as such inconsistencies came to light the strategy would become unsustainable, but the counted ballots cast as of early 2016 suggest it is, despite the latter flaw, still very much viable.

There is also a feeling that she is somehow *owed* the presidency. After all, this is the logical next step in her career, she has a legitimate claim to the throne. Everything she has done so far culminates in this candidacy, her life's not worth if she doesn't at least get a shot. This zeitgeist sadly paves her way to the presidency, even her illegal use of a personal email server in the basement of her private home will not hamper the stratagem.

*I despise Hillary so much it gives me the energy to write the above as well as an R package to download and extract content from her "personal" emails.*
