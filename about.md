This blog is heavily inspired by L'Ami du Peuple, an octavo published by Jean-Paul marat during the years of the French Revolution. The reason for the existence of this very blog is a feeling that is probably best described by Friedrich Von Hayek in The Road to Serfdom.

> Probably it is true that the very magnitude of the outrages committed by the totalitarian governments, instead of increasing the fear that such a system might one day arise in more enlightened countries, has rather strengthened the assurance that it cannot happen here.
> --<cite>Friedrich Von Hayek</cite>
