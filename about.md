This blog is heavily inspired by L'Ami du Peuple, an octavo published by Jean-Paul Marat during the years of the French Revolution, hence "The People's Companion."

The frightening progress towards totalitarianism our society seems destined to compels me to maintain this blog.

> Probably it is true that the very magnitude of the outrages committed by the totalitarian governments, instead of increasing the fear that such a system might one day arise in more enlightened countries, has rather strengthened the assurance that it cannot happen here.
> --<cite>Friedrich Von Hayek</cite>
