The niagara of uncritical build-up of the European Union is intrinsically deceitful.

> Probably it is true that the very magnitude of the outrages committed by the totalitarian governments, instead of increasing the fear that such a system might one day arise in more enlightened countries, has rather strengthened the assurance that it cannot happen here.

The European Union centralises the power of 28 sovereign nations, is void of self-limiting principles, and sees the extent of its power constantly widened, too few have considered the possible outcomes of such an organisation.

> The way they've been building it top down from Brussels is doomed to fail. This is 2016. They are still thinking 1950 economics.

* Decentralisation
    - Term was coined during French revolution
    - Most decisions are made at the local level, which allows for distributed errors that don’t adversely affect the wider system (avoid systemic risk)
    - Hidden risk (expand)
* Antifragitly - decentralised = more flexible, less likely to make big mistakes
* The idea that unification would create an economy that could compete with China and be more like the United States is pure garbage. What ruined China, throughout history, is the top-down state. What made Europe great was the diversity: political and economic. Having the same currency, the euro, was a terrible idea. It encouraged everyone to borrow to the hilt
* EU very remote, no local knowledge, cannot understand implications
* Innovation, creativity, etc. not top down, happens low down the structure (never top)
* Do you know Ode to Joy, your anthem
* European College and European Movement International, creation of aristocracy, elite || very French = École nationale d'administration (ENA)
* Collaboration of small states much different than centralised government (bottom-up vs top-down)

> The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.
